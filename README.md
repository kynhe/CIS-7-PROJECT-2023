Cipher project for CIS7

Project Description:
This program is one that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Vigenere cipher algorithm. The aim is to provide a tool where individuals can enter their plain text and a secret keyword, and see their message transform into a coded version. By using the same keyword, users can easily decode the cipher text and retrieve the original message. To accomplish this, I have utilized C++ programming language and employed various discrete structure programming techniques.

Programming Approaches:
In order to create this program, I have adopted a systematic approach that focuses on breaking down the code into smaller, manageable functions. By doing so, I can ensure that each function handles a specific task efficiently. For instance, I have implemented separate functions for encryption and decryption, which carry out the necessary Vigenere cipher operations on the characters of the text. 

To ensure a logical flow, the program starts from the main function. It prompts the user for input, invokes the encryption and decryption functions accordingly, and then presents the results. By using appropriate data structures like strings, I can effectively handle and process the text data.

This program provides users with a secure and efficient solution for encrypting and decrypting text using the Vigenere cipher algorithm.
