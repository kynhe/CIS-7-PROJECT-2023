Cipher project for CIS7

Project Description:
This program is one that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Vigenere cipher algorithm. The aim is to provide a tool where individuals can enter their plain text and a secret keyword, and see their message transform into a coded version. By using the same keyword, users can easily decode the cipher text and retrieve the original message. To accomplish this, I have utilized C++ programming language and employed various discrete structure programming techniques.

Programming Approaches:
In order to create this program, I have adopted a systematic approach that focuses on breaking down the code into smaller, manageable functions. By doing so, I can ensure that each function handles a specific task efficiently. For instance, I have implemented separate functions for encryption and decryption, which carry out the necessary Vigenere cipher operations on the characters of the text. To ensure a logical flow, the program starts from the main function. It prompts the user for input, invokes the encryption and decryption functions accordingly, and then presents the results. By using appropriate data structures like strings, I can effectively handle and process the text data. This program provides users with a secure and efficient solution for encrypting and decrypting text using the Vigenere cipher algorithm.

Instructions for Using the Text Encryption and Decryption Program:
To use this program, follow these simple steps. First, open the program on your computer. You will see a prompt asking you to enter the plain text that you want to encrypt. Type in your desired message and press Enter. Next, you will be asked to provide a keyword. This keyword will be used to encrypt the text. Once you've entered the keyword, press Enter again. The program will then encrypt the plain text using Vigenere cipher algorithm. After the encryption process is complete, the program will display the encrypted text on the screen. To decrypt the text and retrieve the original message, enter the same keyword that was used for encryption. The program will decrypt the text using the provided keyword and display the decrypted message. Read the decrypted text and access your original message. When you're done, you can exit the program by closing the program window or following your operating system's instructions to terminate the program.
